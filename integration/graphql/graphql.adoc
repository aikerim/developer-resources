== About GraphQL

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/GraphQL_Logo.svg/200px-GraphQL_Logo.svg.png[float=right,width=200]

GraphQL is a specification for querying a slice of an application graph, retrieving a tree of data that perfectly matches a front-end view, regardless of was that data was pulled from.
It covers tree-based read-queries, mutations for updates and subscriptions for live updates.

=== Queries

Queries form a tree structure, based upon entities and relevant attributes.
Any of those can take parameters (e.g for filtering or pagination) and directives.

.GraphQL example query
[source,graphql]
----
query {
   Movie(title:"The Matrix") {
      title
      released
      tagline
      actors {
         name
         born
      }
   }
}
----

.GraphQL example result
[source,json]
----
{
   "Movie": [{
      "title": "The Matrix",
      "released": 1999,
      "tagline": "Welcome to the Real World",
      "actors": [{
         "name": "Keanu Reeves",
         "born": 1964
         }, {
         "name": "Carrie-Anne Moss",
         "born": 1967
         }, {
         "name": "Laurence Fishburne",
         "born": 1961
         }
      ]
   }]
}
----

=== GraphQL as a Contract

In this regard it is a *contract* between front-end and back-end, based on the agreed upon type system which forms an application data model in the form of *a graph*.

It decouples the front-end from the back-end data source(s), which allows you to change both independently as the type system stays consistent.
Each query from the front-end is using that type system to define in a fine grained way which data it is interested in.

There is no prescription how and where the data in the back-end comes from, it can be anything from databases, to APIs, from third party systems to in-memory representations, and even code or static assets.

GraphQL queries return data in a tree-form that perfectly matches the front end view hierarchy. If the application data is a graph, then the perfect back-end is a Graph Database with native support for resolving GraphQL queries: Neo4j.

=== Schema

The typesystem is often declared in schema (IDL) files which contain entities, their attributes, interfaces, enumerations, but also mutations and subscriptions.
The schema can be extended with custom directives and types that allow specific extensions of the core language.

.GraphQL example schema
[source,graphql]
----
type Movie {
    title: String!
    released: Int
    tagline: String
    actors: [Person]
}

type Person {
    name: String!
    born: Int
    movies: [Movie]
}

=== GRANDstack

http://grandstack.io/[GRANDstack^] is a stack for building graph based applications.
GRAND stands for:

* http://graphql.org/[GraphQL^] - A query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
* https://reactjs.org/[React^] - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client[Apollo Client^] - A fully-featured, production ready caching GraphQL client for every server or UI framework
* Neo4j Database

https://twitter.com/lyonwj[Will Lyon^] facilitated a training session at GraphConnect NYC 2017 in which attendees built their first GRANDstack application.

=== Neo4j GraphQL extension

image::https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/graphql-community/raw/master/images/neo4j-graphql-logo.png[width=200,float=right]

We wanted to combine the power of Neo4j and GraphQL by making it super-easy to take an IDL schema OR an existing graph and serve a native GraphQL backend from it.

With the information from the schema we're able to generate a single query against the backing graph database.
During development both Neo4j's property graph model as well as the Cypher query language turned out to be a great fit for the GraphQL features we're supporting so far.

You can grab the latest release our extension from https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/releases[here] and drop it into any Neo4j 3.1.x server (in the `plugins` directory).
After a restart you can either query your graph data using GraphQL *directly* or after posting an IDL file with the schema you like.

We added some neat features that we hope are useful and make your life easier.

We're especially proud of the `@cypher` directive, the auto-generated mutations (create, update, delete), and the `graphql.execute`, `graphql.idl` and `graphql.schema` procedures.

Here is an example, how the schema definition above could / would be extended:

[source,graphql]
----
type Movie {
    title: ID!
    released: Int
    tagline: String

    actors: [Person] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN", direction:IN)

    director: Person @relation(name:"DIRECTED", direction:IN)

    recommendation(first:Int = 3): [Movie]
      @cypher(statement:"MATCH (this)<-[r1:REVIEWED]-(:User)-[r2:REVIEWED]->(reco:Movie)
                         WHERE 3 <= r1.stars <= r2.stars
                         RETURN reco, sum(r2.stars) as rating ORDER BY rating DESC")
}

interface Person {
    name: ID!
    born: Int
}

type Actor extends Person {
    name: ID!
    born: Int

    movies: [Movie] @relation(name:"ACTED_IN")
}

type Director extends Person {
    name: ID!
    born: Int

    movies: [Movie] @relation(name:"DIRECTED")
}

type Mutations {
    directed(movie:ID! director:ID!) : String
      @cypher(statement:"MATCH (m:Movie {title: $movie}), (d:Person {name: $director})
                         MERGE (d)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)")
}
schema {
   mutations: Mutations
}
----

Have a look at the following "feature" table, to see what else is "in the box":

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/master/readme.adoc[tags=features]

In the repository, you can find a https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/blob/master/movies.schema[movies schema] and https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql/blob/master/movies.graphql[accompanying queries], that uses some of those features.

=== neo4j-graphql-js

We've also created the https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js[neo4j-graphql-js^] npm package, which makes it easier to use GraphQL and Neo4j together.

neo4j-graphql-js translates GraphQL queries to a single Cypher query, eliminating the need to write queries in GraphQL resolvers and for batching queries.
It also exposes the Cypher query language through GraphQL via the @cypher schema directive.

=== GraphQL Support

To demonstrate the combined power of a graph database (Neo4j) and GraphQL we also added the GraphQL extension to this server. Access the GraphQL community graph, including GraphiQL http://graphql.communitygraph.org/[here].

After authorising you'll be able to query the GraphQL community graph with your trusted tools like GraphiQL or Apollo-Client.
You can also visualize the Schema using Voyager.

You can find the https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/graphql-community/blob/master/community-graph.schema[schema for the data] and several GraphQL queries and screenshots of your tools in action https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/graphql-community#screenshots[in this repository^].

== Resources

If you want to provide more feedback, just create an issue in any of our http://github.com/neo4j-graphql[neo4j-graphql repositories^],  mailto:devrel@neo4j.com[drop us an email^] or join http://neo4j.com/slack[neo4j-users Slack^] and ask in the #neo4j-graphql channel.

=== Raw Data Access

The raw graph data is publicly accessible here via the Neo4j Browser (http://107.170.69.23:7474 username/pwd: graphql/graphql).

If you are used to Neo4j you can use it right away by writing some link:/developer/cypher[Cypher^] statements.
